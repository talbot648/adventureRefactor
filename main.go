The only way out is to find and solve a series of riddles that lead to the terminal in a hidden room.\nThe challenge? Crack the code on the terminal to unlock the doors. But it's not that simple.\nYou'll need to gather items, approach Alan and Dan for cryptic tips, and outsmart the obstacles they've laid out for you.\nAs the tension rises, only your wits, teamwork, and knowledge can guide you to freedom.\nAre you ready to escape?\nOh and remember... You don't want to make Rosie grumpy! So don't do anything crazy.\n\nif at any point you feel lost, type 'commands' to display the list of all commands.\nThe command 'look' is always useful to get your bearings and see the options available to you.\nThe command 'exit' will make you quit the game at any time.
